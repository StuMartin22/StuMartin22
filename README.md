## About Me

Full stack web developer looking to leverage my 5 year background in scientific research and love of puzzles to analyze and solve challenging problems. A lifelong passion for tech and mobile devices contributes to an efficient, mobile first UX/UI design philosophy. Recently earned a certificate for full stack web development from the University of Minnesota where I learned skills in javascript based front and back end languages and technologies including HTML, CSS, React.js, Node.js, MySQL, and mongoDB. 5 combined years of consultation work in landscaping and mobile has contributed to a desire and continuance of personable, yet effective, communication. Looking forward to utilizing my skills as part of a team to contribute a passion for problem solving, thoughtful, and effective development.
