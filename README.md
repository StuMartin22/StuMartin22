## About Me

Hey there, I'm Stuart (Stu) Martin, pronouns: (he/him)!

I am a full stack web developer that has recently received a certificate from the coding bootcamp sponsored through the University of Minnesota! After many years of never really feeling the right 'fit' when doing varyious jobs, I finally have found where I belong with coding. I loved every second of my bootcamp and am constantly looking forward to the next time that I get to code and debug. The thrill of the hunt and the satisfaction of solving the puzzle is a feeling like no other!

I graduated from Rogers State University in Claremore, OK with a Bachelors of Science in Biology with an emphasis in environmental conservation.

I spent some time towards the end of my time in school interning and volunteering with the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife resources where I was able to work first hand with some of the countries leading biologists in different subjects. Most of my time was spent on the research side of the field with careful measurement and recording of data. I also spent a large portion of time helping to create and implement a new records storage system for the office I worked out of! 

I spent many years off and on in the landscaping and property maintenance field at the end of highschool and through college. This was primarly as an assistant crew leader who helped with the onboarding of new employees and internal conflict resolution. There was also a large portion of that experience that involved consulting for clientele and making sure that their needs were met to the fullest satisfaction. 

Most recently I was employed with AT&T as a retail sales consultant in Burnsville, MN. I had a fantastic time at this position working in tech (one of my long time hobbies/passions) and getting to every day teach people about the products that we had to offer. The challenge of consulting with and understanding our consumers' needs while trying to ensure that they were getting the most value for their dollar was incredibly enjoyable. I frequently came in over quota in sales, once reaching 400% of my monthly sales goal! 

Now, having completed the University of Minnesota's full stack bootcamp, I continue to fall in love with the challenge and complexity of different javascript based languages, how they interact, and the pursuit of not only understanding how to get something to work, but to figure out WHY it works. I've really enjoyed my experience getting to build full stack applications from scratch after having come into this program understanding only the most basic of HTML syntax...

I'm truly excited to continue on this tech journey somewhere I can offer my unique talent set and background to assist in trouble shooting and debugging of code, as well as improving upon what is already established to make the code as streamlined and efficient as possible. I look forwrad to being a part of a team that is as passionate about this work as I am and is ready for a new team mate to take under their wing while I leverage my unique experiences and passions to contribute to the groups success!
